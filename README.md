# Poseidon-Encryption-Decryption-Circom-Implementation
Poseidon Encryption/Decryption with ECDH key-sharing protocol using BN254 elliptic curve. Implemented in circom. 

All test folders contain "main.circom" file with all templates and inputs needed for running the test example. They also contain other files neccessery for generating proofs.
File "main.circom" in root directory contains only templates for Poseidon encryption/decryption and Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key sharing protocol using BN254 curve.
